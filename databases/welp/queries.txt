You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT
   ...> *
   ...> FROM
   ...> reviews
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
1|5|Delicious|6|3|3|Angela|Jolie|6|Sushi World
2|1|AWFUL experience! I will never come back!|3|7|7|Denzel|George|3|The Beagle Nightclub
3|3.5|Nice, but needs a little work.|4|5|5|Holly|Berry|4|Lotus Yoga
4|2.2|Too Bleh!|2|2|2|Mandy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing
5|4.3|Had all the supplies I needed.|1|6|6|Merryl|Streepman|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT
   ...> reviews.starts,reviews.comment,businesses.name,users.last_name
   ...> FROM
   ...> reviews
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM
   ...> reviews
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> WHERE businesses.name = "Sushi World";
