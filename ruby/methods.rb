# 1.  Write a method named add_squares.
#     It has two parameters.  Assume both are integers.
#     The method returns the sum of the two numbers
#     after they've been squared.
#
# Pseudocode:
# Square both numbers
# Add the squares

def add_squares(number, other_number)
  (number ** 2) + (other_number ** 2)
end


# 2. Write a method named calculate_damage.
#    It has two parameters.
#    One parameter is a base damage value (e.g., 10).
#    The second specifies how much of the base damage to apply (e.g., 0.5).
#    The method returns the portion of the base damage specified by the modifier.
#    The method always returns a whole number (e.g., 2.8 would be returned as 2).
#
# Pseudocode:
#



# 3. Write a method named hide_all.
#    It has two parameters.
#    One is a sequence of characters to hide.
#    The second is a message.
#    The method returns a version of the message
#      with all occurances of the sequence to hide
#      changed to a series of underscores.
#      If the sequence were "abc" there would be three underscores.
#
# Pseudocode:
#



# 4. Write a method named calculate_tip.
#    It has two parameters.
#    One is a bill amount. ($5.25 would be passed in as 5.25)
#    The second is the tip percentage.  (15% would be passed in as 0.15)
#    The method returns the tip amount in dollars rounded to the nearest penny. ("$3.17")
#
# Pseudocode:
#



# Below is some driver code that will tell you
# whether your methods are working properly.
# The driver code will only execute
# if you are running this file directly.
# If the file is loaded from another file
# or loaded in IRB, the driver code will not run.
# Don't worry about understanding what it all means.
# It's using some references that Ruby defines.
# $0 is a reference to the file used to start the program.
# __FILE__ is a reference to the currently executing file.
# So, if this file was the file used to start the program,
# then Ruby runs the driver code.
