Virtual Private Server:
	The VPS is a Virtual machine (as in it has no physical parts) it functions as a complete and independent machine with its own Operating system and memory allocation. The main advantage of using this is that they are cheaper and take up less physical space than its physical counterpart.

Root User Linux
	The root user is like the main and far more super powered user, as it is said in almost every spiderman movie cartoon and comics(time they stopped)
	"with great power comes great responsibility". The root user has to be a little cautious about the commands they execute, they might delete something beyond repair, if we use it from a user account the root can be used to recover certain things and can repair some damages caused.
